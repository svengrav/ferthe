# TODO & BUGS

- Trailspots doesn't use FlatList, cannot update or load more spots.

## Bugs

~~- **Spots → Title "Unknown Spots"**: Discovered spots are still displayed as blurred and marked as unknown. Additionally, too many spots are shown at the same time. There are 5 spots available to discover, but only 4 are displayed as locked.~~
~~- **Trail Position in "Discovery Stats"**: The trail position always shows "x of X", which is unclear and confusing.~~
~~- **Trail Image on Trail Screen**: The trail image is not displayed in a square format.~~
~~- **Trail Rating** The trail rating is missing.~~
~~- **Settings → Choose Your Language**: Changing the language (German or English) has no effect. The app remains in English.~~

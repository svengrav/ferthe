# Onboarding

## Welcome Screen

- On first launch, the user sees a multi-slide onboarding screen introducing the core concept.
- The onboarding is shown exactly once and tracked via a settings flag.
- After completing onboarding, a welcome discovery is created at the user's current GPS location.
  This gives a quick win and demonstrates the discovery mechanic immediately.

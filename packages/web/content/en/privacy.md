# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** {date}

## Who we are

This app ("Ferthe") is operated by Sven Gravermann. We respect your privacy and process data in accordance with applicable data protection laws, especially the GDPR.

## What data we collect

- Location data (for navigation and trail recommendations)
- Device information (model, sensors, OS version)
- Usage data (e.g., which features you use)
- Optional phone number verification – see below
- **No registration required** – the app works without an account

## Optional phone number verification

If you choose to verify your phone number, it will be used once for identity verification. The phone number itself is not stored. Instead, a non-reversible hash is created and used to validate your session.

## How we use your data

- To provide personalized trails and recommendations
- For location-based features and navigation
- To improve the app and user experience
- For security and abuse prevention (e.g., one-time verification)

## Third-party services

We may use third-party services such as Google Maps or Firebase. These providers process data according to their own privacy policies.

## Your rights (EU GDPR)

You have the right to:

- Access your stored data
- Correct inaccurate data
- Request deletion of your data
- Object to data processing (where applicable)

## Contact

If you have any questions or wish to exercise your rights, contact us at:
